                <p>My name is Allana Mae B. Estaquio, and I am a first-year student at Partido State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and have started learning programming languages such as C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. My goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst in the future, and I am committed to honing my skills to achieve this aspiration. One of my hobbies is watching coding-related videos on YouTube, which helps me expand my knowledge and stay inspired in my programming journey. I am excited to continue exploring the world of technology and contribute to innovative solutions in the field.</p>
